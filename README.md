## Graduate Thesis' Supplementary Materials

This repository is a part of the accompanying materials for the graduate 
thesis on the topic: _«The Impact of Economic Nationalism in the European Union on the 
Economic Development of Member States: A Comparative Empirical Analysis»_.

This repository provides materials with which to **replicate** and **develop** 
the research findings. 
Also, here one can take a deeper look at the results of _robustness checks_ 
of the presented models compared to those specified in the study materials.

The **purpose** of publishing these materials in the public domain is
to ensure academic transparency of the study and to enable 
academic verification and criticism of the methodologies used 
and the conclusions drawn.

This repository **will not** provide a detailed description of the 
theoretical framework and methodology used. More details can be found directly 
in the text of the paper, which can also be downloaded here.
